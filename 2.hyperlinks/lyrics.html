        <pre>
            May I be like Mary
            Open to the movements of Your heart (thank You, Jesus)
            Blessed in the keeping of Your promise
            A faithful friend of God

            May I love Your presence, Jesus
            More than any gift You've given me
            More than any crown I could receive
            More than all my dreams
            
            If I could have anything
            Let it be Your eyes on me
            Every time I catch Your gaze
            My world starts changing
            
            I don't have that much to bring
            Just a simple song to sing
            If I could have anything
            Let me be an offering (if I could have)
            
            If I could have anything
            Let it be Your eyes on me
            Every time I catch Your gaze
            My world starts changing
            
            I don't have that much to bring
            Just a simple song to sing
            If I could have anything
            Let me be an offering
            
            And may I be like David (yeah!)
            Unconvinced by power or by idols
            And worshipping in triumph and in trial
            A faithful friend of God
            
            And may I love Your Spirit
            More than reputation or prestige, yeah
            And more than what the world could think of me
            'Cause Your love is all I need
            
            If I could have anything
            Let it be Your eyes on me
            'Cause every time I catch Your gaze
            My world starts changing
            
            I don't have that much to bring
            Just a simple song to sing
            If I could have anything
            Let me be an offering (just let me be)
            Let me be an offering
            
            Oh, I come alive loving You
            I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
            My words fall short when I look at You
            Oh, oh, oh
            
            Oh, I come alive loving You
            I'm overwhelmed by the way You move

            Oh, oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
            
            I come alive loving You
            I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
            My words fall short when I look at You
            Oh, oh, oh
            
            Oh, I come alive loving You
            I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
            My words fall short when I look at You
            Oh, oh, oh (I come alive)
            
            Oh, I come alive loving You
            Oh, I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
            My words fall short when I look at You (oh)
            Oh, oh, oh
            
            I come alive (yeah) loving You
            Oh, I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
            My words fall short when I look at You (oh, oh)
            Oh, oh, oh
            
            If I could have anything
            Let it be Your eyes on me
            Every time I catch Your gaze
            My world starts changing (my world)
